# Loan-Prediction
The main objective for this project is to use various machine learning techniques to determine whether a person will get his/her loan approved (Yes or No) . Here, I used the 6 Most common machine learing alogrithms for classfiation:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Na√Øve Bayes
6. K-Nearest Neighbors

In the end, I also compare the the accuracy of these models to discern which one is the most accurate.
